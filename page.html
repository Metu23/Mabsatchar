        The origins of achaar can be traced back to ancient India, where it was a popular condiment made by pickling fruits and vegetables in a mixture of spices and salt. The use of pickling was an effective way to preserve food, especially during the monsoon season when fresh produce was scarce.

      <h2 class="section-title">Atchar</h2>
      <p>A spicy condiment similar to a chutney in consistency and usually made with lime or mango. Atchar goes hand in hand with Indian or South African dishes and is especially delicious on a kota, african cuisines and many more dishes.
      </p>
      <p>The complex savoury flavours of the atchar help to enhance the umami of the main dishes 
      with which it is served. To give the dishes a little more body, several complementary 
      toppings are normally added to it, such as green onion, garlic, and hot peppers.

              <p>There are two main kinds of tofu: silken and regular. Silken tofu also called 
              soft, silk, or Japanese-style tofu has a softer consistency than regular tofu and will 
              fall apart if not handled carefully.

              <p>You’ll find this fermented soybean paste in the refrigerated section of Asian
              markets and most grocery stores. For this recipe, look for white miso paste.
              Because it’s fermented for less time than darker types of miso, such as red
              miso, it has a milder, sweeter flavor that’s delicious in this simple soup.

              <h3 class="skill-title">Hot Atchar</h3>
              <p>Wakame is a species of sea vegetable, commonly referred to as seaweed, extensively 
              used in Japanese and other Asian cuisines, especially in soups, salads, and snacks, but 
              also as a seasoning. Wakame is deep green in color; it is occasionally referred to 
              as "sea mustard," likely because it resembles mustard greens when cooked, but not 
              because of its mild flavor, which is unlike the peppery vegetable.
